# pattern-recognition-implementation

This repository is about Python-implemented classic machine learning algorithm/model based on my Homework of 2018 spring Tsinghua Pattern Recognition course instructed by Professor Changshui Zhang, including:

+ Maximum Likelihood Estimation
+ Expectation Maximization
+ Support Vector Machine
+ Nearest Neighbor
+ Dicision Tree
+ Dimension Reduction algorithm
+ Ensemble learning
+ Clustering
+ Feature Selection

Use for study purpose, understand it by re-implementation but not just copy & paste.
